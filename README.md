## Summary of the Project

This is project that I implemented in a workshop called Mission Data in formation program of Wild Code School. I analysed the electric vehicle dataset of Washington in three days under rules of workshop and I
deployed it on Streamlit. In addition that, I made a presentation on Canvas website. The client is managing the fleet of electric and hybrid cars in different states of the country and they demanded from me to
analyse the dataset deeply for seeing which areas need improvement.
